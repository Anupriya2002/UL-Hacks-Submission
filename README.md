# UL-Hacks-Submission

Name: Anupriya Dubey
Submission Date: August 14, 2021

This is my submission to the UL Hacks Hackathon. This repository contains a README and the source code for my project. The theme of this hackathon was to empower learning and so I have created a console based program designed to help students practice various problem sets in any discipline to better prepare for any assignments and examinations. This program was written in C++ using VS Code.
